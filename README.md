# db-assignment
AltSchool Second Semester Database design assignment
## Context
Company X wants us to build their next product. This product is an `inventory management system` and they want us to provide database information before building the application.

They have items/products they are willing to sell or use within their organization. They would like admins to be able to create, update, view and delete items but other users can only see items. Users can only place orders on these items and admins get to approve or disapprove these orders. Every item has its own category.

Items can have name, price, size, a category, and other things you as the developer have in mind
Size can either be small, medium or large
We can have as many categories as we would like, but every item must belong to a category
